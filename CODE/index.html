        <h2>Interests</h2>  
        <p>Media influenced my childhood a lot while growing up. Movies like The Fast and The Furious franchise, the various Pokemon movies, and countless superhero action films were on constant rotation in my household. These movies and many like them continue to consume my time due to the exposure I received as a child.</p>
        <p>Video Games filled my time spent alone as a child due to my parents working a lot. After schol I would be the first to be home all I ever did was play video games like Fifa and WWE. My favorite video games growing up consisted of:</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>   
        <p>A hobby passed down from my parents is gardening. I enjoy going to Home Depot and picking plants to later then plant. What fascinates me the most are fruits like tomatoes and jalapenos because they're easier to maintain and low cost.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is working on electronic devices. I enjoy disassembling devices because I like seeing the different components that make a device function. Plus the added challenge of remembering how to reassemble them.

        <h2>Goals</h2> 
        <p>My immediate goal is to graduate and receive my diploma. Getting past the hurdle of figuring out what I would like to do as a career was difficult. However, I now understand what it is I would like to do.</p>
        <p>My secondary goal is to go to every state in the United States. I currently have most of the southeastern side of the country covered as well as Oklahoma and Nevada. Hopefully in the future can explore the rest of the country.</p>
